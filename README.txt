Copy of winjcom from http://www.engidea.com/blog/informatica/winjcom/winjcom.html

This copy has been modified in the renaming of Java packages and C source files.

This copy is staged here for future work in rewriting HANDLE/FD jint's to jlong's, and testing under 64 bit windows.

Additionally, a File interface should make available some class static state for system load library invocation alternatives.
